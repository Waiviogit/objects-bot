# What is an object?
An **object** on Waivio is a user-created entity such as a restaurant, hashtag, business, product, etc.,  which is given a unique URL (permlink) on the Hive blockchain. It serves as a specific reference point that can be linked to posts and contributes to the structured accumulation of knowledge within the Waivio and Hive ecosystem.

# Simplified concept of the object system
Simplified concept: The object type is a post, and each first-level comment under it is an object. Second-level comments and beyond are its updates. Users add updates through our bots and vote for them; updates with the most votes win.

Field or update (noun), or field-update, the same thing with the same meaning, can be called interchangeably in this document.


# Object types
Object types that you might be interested in include: product, book, business, restaurant, list, and page. 

Each of these types has a list of fields, which represents the information that can be added to each object.


**List of fields that the user can add for each object type:**

|Object type|Fields |
|---|---|
|product|status, avatar, authority, name, title, background, parent, tagCategory, categoryItem, galleryAlbum, galleryItem, sortCustom, rating, price, description, website, productId, dimensions, productWeight, groupId, options, departments, merchant, manufacturer, brand, features, pin, remove, menuItem, related, addOn, similar, delegation|
|business|status, avatar, authority, name, title, background, parent, tagCategory, categoryItem, galleryAlbum, galleryItem, sortCustom, rating, price, description, workTime, address, map, website, phone, email, companyId, pin, remove, menuItem, walletAddress, delegation|
|restaurant|status, avatar, authority, name, title, background, parent, tagCategory, categoryItem, galleryAlbum, galleryItem, sortCustom, rating, price, description, workTime, address, map, website, phone, email, companyId, pin, remove, menuItem, walletAddress, delegation| 
|list|status, avatar, authority, name, title, background, parent, tagCategory, categoryItem, galleryAlbum, galleryItem, website, description, listItem, sortCustom, pin, remove, delegation|
|page|status, avatar, authority, name, title, background, parent, tagCategory, categoryItem, galleryAlbum, galleryItem, pageContent, website, description, pin, remove, delegation|

(Details for each field are provided below.)

# "field" detailed information
Now, when you know main details about how to make request to add update-field, here you can read about each specif field in details.


## address
Field for adding an address.

`body` - a stringified object that contains the following fields:
- "address" - full address text.
- "street" - street name.
- "city" - city name.
- "state" - state name.
- "postalCode" - postal code information.
- "country" - country information.
All fields type: string.
```
// example
{
  "name": "address",
  "body": "{\"address\":\"testFullAddress\",\"street\":\"testStreet\",\"city\":\"testCity\",\"state\":\"testState\",\"postalCode\":\"testPostalCode1111\",\"country\":\"testCountry\"}",
  "locale": "en-US"
}
```


## addOn
The add-on field is for including additional objects that users might find interesting, providing a way to connect one object with another.

`body` - object permlink of the object that will be added.

```
// example
{
  "name": "addOn",
  "body": "hfa-test-product-14031521",
  "locale": "en-US"
}
```


## authority
The authority field is claims rights for the object from user. Has two options: administrative, ownership.

The meaning of this function is that the site owner in the Administrators section can then add users whom he trusts and they automatically have admin rights to the objects they claim.
For example, a manufacturer posted descriptions of its products on the Hive blockchain and indicated itself as the Ownership authority for these objects. And if the site owner adds this user as a trusted authority, then all his products will automatically appear on the site. And when a trusted authority adds, removes or edits objects, these changes are immediately displayed on the site.

- Administrative means that the fields can be changed by other users, but if the authority account voted Approve or Reject, then this is the final vote.

- Ownership means that only fields that are Approved will be taken into account when composing the object, and all that are not directly approved will be skipped.


`body` - has two options: administrative, ownership.
